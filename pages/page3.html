             Today I worked on my Core Studio Interaction project. I was considering adding sounds and shapes tto my project for which i had to record the objects in my image along with the visuals.

           I started with recording the sounds of the Lang cafe. I ended up overhearing a lot of conversations in the audio which influenced my design choice.

        <h4>
          After attending my political economy lecture, I was inspired to add a human touch to my project since all the sounds I recorded sounded very technical.
        </h4>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="imgs/day3/sound3.jpg" height="300vw" width="300vw">
        </div>
        <h4>
         While sitting in the Cafe, I also noticed the lights being reflected on the window in the front of me. I decided to take a photo so i could try and trace the shapes to add to the sound of the image.
