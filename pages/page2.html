             While having back to back classes, I had design projects to finish. It was a productive day in the end but the process was stressful.

            After designing an infographic I started finishing some low-fidelity wireframes forr my next project. After brainstorming the interaction I decided to take a break and design a booklett for my advanced type class.

            This project was challenging as not only did I have to design three booklets but also find a way to connect the grid and typographic system under the condition that each booklet had to be of a different size and page number.

           I went back to sketching and getting my ideas out for the high-fidelity mockup of the app. I managed to get everytthing I planned finished finally which was a relief.
